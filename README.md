Library Management System

The frontend of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a user-friendly interface for users to interact with. The backend of the application is powered by Java servlets and JSP, which handle the processing of data and communication with the database. The database itself is built using MySQL, and all sensitive data is encrypted using AES encryption for added security. Overall, this system allows for efficient and secure management of the library's resources.
